	<p class="para">Fair warning: there’s a band of Rogue Killers out there. We don’t know who they are, or why they’re out there, but we do know that they’re powerful enough to have broken into a Saudi embassy, savvy enough to have murdered a Washington Post reporter who just happened to be a major thorn in Saudi Arabia’s side, slick enough that no one inside the building noticed them, and strange enough to have done all of this just for kicks – or so Donald Trump now wants us to believe.</p>

	<p class="para">Amid mounting pressure from the public, the media, and the world, Donald Trump finally got on the phone with the King of Saudi Arabia to discuss the disappearance and apparent murder of Jamal Kashoggi, which was obviously ordered by the King’s deranged son. The trouble is, the Crown Prince happens to be a major personal benefactor to Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, a reminder that monarchies and nepotism are a bad idea in general, as are allowing broke criminals like Trump and Kushner to occupy the White House.</p>

	<p class="para">To the surprise of no one, Donald Trump came away from his phone call with the conclusion that Saudi Arabia couldn’t have done it, because Saudi Arabia says it didn’t do it. Just like Brett Kavanaugh couldn’t have assaulted any of those women, because he said he didn’t. It’s funny how Trump only believes the bad guys in these situations, and only believes men, and only believes the people who are playing for his team, but I digress. The point here is that Trump is now blaming the Kashoggi murder on “Rogue Killers.”</p>

	<p class="para">It was such a laugh out loud asinine response, the phrase “Rogue Killers” promptly began trending on Twitter. It’s a reminder that mainstream Americans, outside Donald Trump’s mentally compromised cult, see him for the two-bit idiot that he is. It’s also a reminder that Trump won’t dare stand up to the royal family of Saudi Arabia for the same reason he won’t stand up to Vladimir Putin: they literally own his broke ass.</p>
